# PROJECT UPDATE
This project has been a simple website design idea that I ahve been working on, however, it has been cast aside due to personal issues. In an attempt to rekindle the website, I will be partially rewriting this to utilize Facebook, Inc.'s React, and React Native JavaScript libraries. This will help solidify my understanding of JavaScript, while, hopefully, allowing me to develop using React Native for all platforms in the future.
