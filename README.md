# PROJECT UPDATE
This project has been a simple website design idea that I ahve been working on, however, it has been cast aside due to personal issues. In an attempt to rekindle the website, I will be partially rewriting this to utilize Facebook, Inc.'s React, and React Native JavaScript libraries. This will help solidify my understanding of JavaScript, while, hopefully, allowing me to develop using React Native for all platforms in the future.


### To Run Server
Start by installing any dependencies from the package.json file:
```
npm install
```
then run:
```
node index.js
```

This will start the node server, and the website will load.
